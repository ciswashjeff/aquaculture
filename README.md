# Aquaculture Simulation fish: 	:seedling:

This is a Continous-Time Simulation of the fluctuation of chemicals in an Aquarium system. The chemicals we are keeping track of in the state of our aquarium are: Ammonium, Nitrite, Nitrate, Nitrogen gas, Disolved Oxygen and pH. Our goal is to predict if an aquarium configuration (Size, Temp, Lighting, Fish, Plants) will be self sufficent, require water changes / feeding or will not support life.
